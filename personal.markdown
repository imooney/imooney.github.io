I am a proud husband to a poetic, brilliant spouse since 2023 and dog-dad to a big, dumb Pyrador since 2018. I'm a reader, although not nearly as prolific as my wife. My favorite genres are sci-fi and fantasy, although I've been expanding my palate into other genres recently. Lately, I've also been diving more into the film-world as well. I've been steadily building a repository of reviews of books and movies so I can remember how I felt about them years from now. I love music of all kinds, and am a lapsed instrumentalist. I'm a big language nerd and have casually learned small bits of 10 or so. I even minored in French in college! But lately I've been trying to focus on one (Spanish) and become fluent, before my brain plasticity decreases too much to do so. To get started with a language, I like the app Pimsleur (they are not paying me to say this), which helps build conversationality very quickly. Then I watch shows in the language with English subtitles until I feel comfortable switching to subtitles in the language. I've seen some great Spanish-language shows and learned the dialect from different countries as a result -- "La Reina del Flow" was a wild ride. I use Duolingo less than I used to although I do appreciate its topic-specific units for learning vocabulary. Recently, I discovered that one can learn chess on the app, so I've been improving quite a bit!

On the athletic side of things, I've been a swimmer for quite a long time, but I walked a 5k in February and decided it would be nice to try to run one for the first time. I have been working toward a goal of a quick result and broke the 20-minute barrier on November 1. Now it's on to the next milestone of 19. I also bought a road bike late this summer and will be getting more into riding. At some point I may even try a triathlon!
