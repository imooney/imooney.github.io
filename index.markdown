<h1> About me </h1>

### Current
I am an associate research scientist at Yale's Wright Lab, working in the [Relativistic Heavy-Ion Group](https://rhig.physics.yale.edu/), and a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Lab and the Center for Frontiers of Nuclear Science at Stony Brook University. I study the strong interaction, one of nature's four fundamental forces, especially under extreme conditions such as those created in collisions of heavy ions like gold at almost the speed of light at the [Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) (RHIC). My research focuses on using energetic jets of particles as tomographic probes to map the microscopic structure of the hot soup of strongly-interacting particles produced in the most energy-dense collisions. See the Research page for more details. See also the Personal page for my interests outside of physics.

### Graduate
I completed my graduate studies in the [Relativistic Heavy-Ion Group](https://clas.wayne.edu/physics/research/nuclear-experimental) at Wayne State University in 2022. For my [PhD thesis](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2623477), I studied properties of the jets mentioned above in collisions where the soup of quarks and gluons is not believed to form, to improve our understanding of quark and gluon evolution in a vacuum and their binding into collective objects called hadrons. I also searched for potential modification to these processes through interaction with a nucleus.

### Undergraduate
My undergraduate studies were completed at the University of Michigan, where I carried out research with the [Aidala group](https://websites.umich.edu/~caidala/index.html) on the [SeaQuest/E906 experiment](https://www.phy.anl.gov/mep/drell-yan/) at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The experiment used quark-anti-quark annihilation to map the relative contribution of each to the structure of hadrons. My main contribution was in improving the event reconstruction algorithm.

### Early life
I became interested in physics at eight years old when I stumbled on *The Universe in a Nutshell* by Stephen Hawking at the local library. Ironically, my fascination at the time was with supermassive black holes, quasars, and other enormous astrophysical objects mentioned in the book, while my research career has gone in completely the opposite direction, to study the smallest objects humanity can currently empirically access. One of my passions is helping young people discover their curiosity about the world around them as I did many years ago, and interesting them in the field of physics. I especially attempt to reach students from backgrounds not typically represented in our field. Please see the Images page for some photos from outreach activities I have been involved in, among others.

TBD: separate CV page or no?
TBD: Should it be blog style with particular days, or just by category?
TBD: News tab for the blog style stuff?
can use the newspaper icon for news items on the blog
TBD: in the description, you should mention each page. Once you do, figure out how to make them links.
