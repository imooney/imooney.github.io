For future reference: git pushes will update the website automatically. To test changes, run 'bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --livereload' locally, and view in a browser with "http://localhost:4000/". When done, a barebones git flow works fine: "git add .", "git commit -m "message"", "git push origin main". _site/ files will not push, so you don't have to worry about those, it will rebuild them before it updates the site on the server.
