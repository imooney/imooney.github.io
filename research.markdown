I am currently a member of the STAR Collaboration, which is in its last year of data-taking. Over the years, the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) has collided many ion species. I have done analyses in a variety of them, with different purposes to each measurement. Here I name a few. In proton-proton collisions, I have examined the substructure of QCD jets to map the flow of energy as the jet develops, and isolate the hadronization process by which quarks and gluons re-form into hadrons. I have made similar measurements in the slightly larger system of proton-gold collisions. This work attempts to address the puzzling state of affairs in which all of the hallmarks of collective behavior exist in the most energy-dense of these collisions, pointing to a deconfined fluid of quarks and gluons, but none of the tomographic probes (jets, heavy-flavor particles) are modified. It also tests the degree of jet modification in the cold nucleus as they exit the collision. In larger systems, a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is definitively formed in the most head-on collisions. I have studied the potential modification of yields of charged hadrons (proxies for jets) after engineering samples of events in which this hot, thermalized medium's geometry is elliptical, and requiring the hadrons to travel either along its major or minor axis. This may allow for an in situ medium-path-length difference, which when paired with modification to the yields would allow for an extraction of the path-length dependence of energy modification of color-charged particles in a colored medium.

I am also beginning to prepare for the [Electron-Ion Collider](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/) which will take RHIC's place in a decade by getting involved in hardware work for the Longitudinally-segmented Forward Hadronic Calorimeter. This detector will be critical to realize the goals of the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider experiment (ePIC), as it measures the hadronic energy depositions from jets formed in the breakup of the proton or ion in these collisions. I am traveling to CERN soon for a test-beam with a few modules of the detector, and am currently helping to lead a test-bench quality-control campaign for the silicon photomultipliers. When the ePIC detector comes online, it will allow us to answer many questions, including the degree of potential modification of jet energy flows and hadronization in the cold nucleus in a much cleaner environment than proton-gold or gold-gold collisions. It will be an exciting new paradigm for jet studies.
